### Live Server
*	Barebones, easy, beginner server. Will use this for now but in the future move to Express and Webpack dev servers

``` live-server myFolder/ ```

### CDN React
*	Going to just use a CDN for react now because we're just starting off. Will switch at some later point.
* 	There's react native for apps, react vr for vr and react dom for browser

### JSX
*	JavaScript XML
*	var foo can be set to any type

### Babel
*	JS compiler, used to compile JSX to normal JS

### Yarn init
*	We use yarn init to make the initial package.json file with information on it

### Node Modules
*	Will never need these files. They're all the files related to the dependencies that you installed that they need. This is their dependencies, package files, etc.

### Yarn.lock file
*	Just gives you more information about your dependencies to help you check that your dependencies are right. It will change automatically.

### App.js
*	App.js in the root is going to contain the JSX that we write ourselves. App.js in the scripts folder is going to contain the output of the compiled JSX through Babel.

### Compiling with Babel command
*	babel {source file} --out-file={output file} --presets=env,react --watch
*	Watch is just used for hot reloading of the JSX
